### Personal Statement

When I began researching ancient Greek mathematics, I quickly found that many primary resources were hidden among different publications, many of them in languages I could not read. However, this website is not only a list of ancient Greek sources that reference Euclid, but it aids in answering a larger question that involves my studies: how was Euclid’s Elements studied in ancient education? By answering smaller, more quantitative questions such as, how many primary resources (mainly, ostraka and papyri) feature Euclid’s Elements?, and what is the information embedded in these resources?, I can begin to understand how to answer the larger question at hand. Overall, the website may have started as a personal project to answer specific research questions, but it also reflects an additional goal to create a comprehensive database of resources and an accessible webpage for any user.

The purpose of the project is to be an educational tool for educational tools. While studying the development of ancient Greek mathematics, I have found that pedagogy and learning have been largely ignored motivators for mathematics, despite being the only true constant throughout generations. By understanding how mathematics was learned and taught, I will hopefully be able to understand the effectiveness of proof structure, the use of diagrams, and even how to apply ancient learning to modern-day education. Essentially, the website is a database, but the purpose goes far beyond, as I hope to prove the importance of pedagogy in the development of ancient Greek mathematical proofs. Now, I will describe the website’s characteristics and how through the process of creating the website, my goals have been stagnated and achieved.

For this project, I utilized GitHub Pages and created my map with Peripleo. GitHub Pages is an easy tool for first-time website creators, providing templates that allow for a simple and quick design, and using plain-text md files. Since my goal was accessibility, the straightforward format of GitHub Pages is effective. For the front page of my website, I have embedded a Peripleo map for users to interact with and view the data. Unlike the Resources Page, the map allows users to view the content by location, rather than by publication. However, while most of the data that I have implemented thus far have included a precise location, the few that do not have an exact location to map. I understand that this is not a unique problem when it comes to ancient objects, so I have still included the approximate location on the map and made a note on the resource’s page to indicate that it does not have a precise location. Overall, Github and Peripleo maps have been an effective backbone of my project, creating both a simple, easy-to-use website and an interactive feature.

Further, instead of fixating on the aesthetic details of my website, I opted for a simpler, more accessible design. When compiling a database of recourses from various publications, accessibility is at the forefront. Still, as I continue adding resources to the database, I must adapt my design. My original design inspiration was the PHI Epigraphy Project, which is overall not exactly the most aesthetically appealing webpage. However, the design PHI uses is straightforward, making the webpage relatively easy to navigate, especially for new users. For the main page, I have included two linked pages, Resources and About Me, and a map. The resources page contains links to pages for the various resources, listing them next to other resources of the same publication, if applicable. There is very little room between the main page and accessing the resources, which promotes accessibility. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to having such a simple design. The lack of comprehensibility does not allow for easy navigation, especially if you are a user who does not already know the website's contents. As the database grows larger, I will need to adapt my design to maintain the amount of accessibility that I began with. 

From the start project, I have had several setbacks, which have impacted the quality of the website, but did not prevent me from achieving my goals. First, I began with little knowledge of GitHub Pages, so I had a slow start. However, the most significant setback was my failure to include an interactive feature, which I had originally planned. The theme of the website is ancient Greek mathematics education, so I envisioned the user to view themself as a student. An interactive feature would connect the user with the mathematical content that simply reading could not. However, “interactive diagram” demanded more computer science skills and a more functional computer than I had readily at hand. Instead, I opted last-minute for gif animations of diagrams. The animated diagrams display the diagram drawn in the resource in different stages of the proof’s argument. In the resource itself, the diagram is unlettered and drawn in full, with little indication of what the drawing process was. While non-interactive animated gifs are not an ideal way to have users interact with the information, I have found that it still include information that would have been lost otherwise. So, despite the setbacks, the current website still achieves the goals at hand: compiling information, making the information accessible, and working to answer my personal research questions. 

Looking forward, I plan to make several modifications to my website, some ongoing and simple, such as adding more resources and adjusting and adding to the Peripleo map, and some more ambitious. To improve navigation, I want to include a text search function. To make each resource page more concise and easy to read, I want to divide the information into tabs instead of one long scroll. Finally, while my computer science skills will need to improve as well, I want to update my animated diagrams by including an interactive feature. 

The website is a work in progress, much like my own skills in computer science, but the process of creating the website has improved my technical skills and my understanding of ancient Greek mathematics. As this website continues to grow, I am assured I will, too.
